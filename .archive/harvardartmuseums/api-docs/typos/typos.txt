58 | The `next` and `prev` fields in the info block provide a handy shortcut for paging forward and backward through records. They will contain a fully formed URL to the next and previous pages of records. Send a new request to the value in the `next` field to move forward. Check for the existance of the `next` and `prev` fields to determine if you are at the begining or end of your results.
