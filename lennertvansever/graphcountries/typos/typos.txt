50 | The data from [restcountries.eu](https://restcountries.eu/) is scraped with a JS script and inserted into a Neo4j graph database. Afterwards the GraphQL schema is automagically infered by the awesome [neo4j-graphql-js](https://github.com/neo4j-graphql/neo4j-graphql-js) package. We add some custom cypher queries to the schema to make the shortest path and distance data possible. Finally an Apollo server is used to create the GraphQL endpoint and playground.
