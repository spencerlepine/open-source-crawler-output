This web app has access to cookies and other credentials associated with the web server's operations. There is a cross site scripting vulnerability in GraphQL Playground that allows for arbitrary JavaScript code execution in your web server's origin. If a user clicks a specially crafted link to your GraphQL Playground page served by Apollo Server, an attacker can steal cookies and other private browser data.\n\nDetails of the underlying GraphQL Playground vulnerability are available in [this `graphql playground` advisory (https://github.com/graphql/graphql playground/security/advisories/GHSA 59r9 6jp6 jcm7). (A [similar vulnerability (https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/security/advisories/GHSA x4r7 m2q9 69c8) exists in the related `graphiql` project.) This advisory focuses on identifying whether *Apollo Server* installations are vulnerable and mitigating the vulnerability in Apollo Server; see the other advisories for details on the XSS vulnerability itself.\n\nThe impact of this vulnerability is more severe if (as is common) your GraphQL server's origin URL is an origin that is used to store sensitive data such as cookies.\n\nIn order for this vulnerability to affect your Apollo Server installation, it must actually serve GraphQL Playground. The integration between Apollo Server and GraphQL Playground is different in Apollo Server 2 and Apollo Server 3. You can tell which version of Apollo Server you are running by looking at the version of the [package from which you import the `ApolloServer` class (https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo server/integrations/middleware/): this may be `apollo server`, `apollo server express`, `apollo server lambda`, etc.\n\n#### Apollo Server 3\n\nApollo Server 3 does not serve GraphQL Playground by default. It has a [landing page plugin system (https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo server/api/plugin/landing pages/) and the default plugin is a simple splash page that is not vulnerable to this exploit, linking to Apollo Sandbox Explorer. (We chose to change the default because GraphQL Playground is not actively maintained.)\n\nIf you are running Apollo Server 3, then you are *only* vulnerable if you *explicitly* import the [`ApolloServerPluginLandingPageGraphQLPlayground` (https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo server/api/plugin/landing pages/#graphql playground landing page) plugin and pass it to your `ApolloServer`'s constructor in the `plugins` array. Otherwise, this advisory does not apply to your server.\n\n#### Apollo Server 2\n\nApollo Server 2 serves GraphQL Playground by default, unless the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is set to `production`, or if you explicitly configure it via the `playground` option to the `ApolloServer` constructor.\n\nYour Apollo Server 2 installation is vulnerable if *any* of the following is true:\n  You pass `playground: true` to the `ApolloServer` constructor\n  You pass some other object like `playground: {title: \"Title\"}` to the `ApolloServer` constructor\n  You do *not* pass any `playground` option to the `ApolloServer` constructor, *and* the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is *not* set to `production`\n\n#### Apollo Server 1\n\nApollo Server 1 included `graphiql` instead of `graphql playground`. `graphiql` isn't automatically enabled in Apollo Server 1: you have to explicitly call a function such as `graphiqlExpress` to enable it. Because Apollo Server 1 is not commonly used, we have not done a detailed examination of whether the integration between Apollo Server 1 and `graphiql` is vulnerable to a similar exploit. If you are still using Apollo Server 1, we recommend you disable `graphiql` by removing the `graphiqlExpress` call, and then upgrade to a newer version of Apollo Server.\n\n### Patches and workarounds\n\nThere are several approaches you can take to ensure that your server is not vulnerable to this issue.\n\n#### Upgrade Apollo Server\n\nThe vulnerability has been patched in Apollo Server 2.25.3 and Apollo Server 3.4.1. To get the patch, upgrade your [Apollo Server entry point package (https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo server/integrations/middleware/) to one of the fixed versions; this package may be `apollo server`, `apollo server express`, `apollo server lambda`, etc. Additionally, if you depend directly on `apollo server core` in your `package.json`, make sure that you upgrade it to the same version.\n\n#### Upgrade Playground version only\n\nIf upgrading to the latest version of Apollo Server 2 or 3 quickly will be challenging, you can configure your current version of Apollo Server to serve the latest version of the GraphQL Playground app. This will pin your app to serve a specific version of GraphQL Playground and you will not receive updates to it when you upgrade Apollo Server later, but this may be acceptable because GraphQL Playground is not actively maintained.\n\nThe way to do this depends on what version of Apollo Server you're using and if you're already configuring GraphQL Playground.\n\n  **Apollo Server 3**: If you are using Apollo Server 3, then you are only vulnerable if your serve explicitly calls [`ApolloServerPluginLandingPageGraphQLPlayground` (https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo server/api/plugin/landing pages/#graphql playground landing page) and passes it to the Apollo Server constructor in the `plugins` array. Add the option `version: '1.7.42'` to this call, so it looks like:\n```\nplugins: [ApolloServerPluginLandingPageGraphQLPlayground({version: '1.7.42'}) \n```\n  **Apollo Server 2 with no explicit `playground` option**: If you are using Apollo Server 2 and do not currently pass the `playground` option to `new ApolloServer`, add a `playground` option like so: \n```\nnew ApolloServer({ playground: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? false : { version: '1.7.42' } })\n```\n  **Apollo Server 2 with `playground: true` or `playground: {x, y, z}`**: If you are using Apollo Server 2 and currently pass `true` or an object to `new ApolloServer`, pass the `version` option under the `playground` option like so:\n```\nnew ApolloServer({ playground: { version: '1.7.42', x, y, z } })\n```\n\n#### Disable GraphQL Playground\n\nIf upgrading Apollo Server or GraphQL Playground is challenging, you can also disable GraphQL Playground.\n\nIn Apollo Server 3, remove the call to `ApolloServerPluginLandingPageGraphQLPlayground` from your `ApolloServer` constructor's `plugins` array. This will replace GraphQL Playground with a simple splash page. See [the landing page plugins docs (https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo server/api/plugin/landing pages/) for details.\n\nIn Apollo Server 2, add `playground: false` to your `ApolloServer` constructor: `new ApolloServer({ playground: false })`. This will replace GraphQL Playground with an attempt to execute a GraphQL operation, which will likely display an error in the browser.\n\nIf you disable GraphQL Playground, any users who rely on it to execute GraphQL operations will need an alternative, such as the [Apollo Studio Explorer's account free Sandbox (https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/explorer/#account free sandbox).\n\n### Credit\n\nThis vulnerability was discovered by @Ry0taK. Thank you!\n\nThe fix to GraphQL Playground was developed by @acao and @glasser with help from @imolorhe, @divyenduz, and @benjie.\n\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Read the [`graphql playground` advisory (https://github.com/graphql/graphql playground/security/advisories/GHSA 59r9 6jp6 jcm7)\n* Open an issue in [the `apollo server` repo (https://github.com/apollographql/apollo server/)\n* If the issue involves confidential information, email us at [security@apollographql.com (mailto:security@apollographql.com)\n\nUpgrade to version 2.25.3 or later\n            ", "related_urls": []}

Additionally, on Windows systems, long path portions would resolve to the same file system entities as their 8.3 \"short path\" counterparts. A specially crafted tar archive could thus include directories with two forms of the path that resolve to the same file system entity, followed by a symbolic link with a name in the first form, lastly followed by a file using the second form.

The `String.normalize('NFKD')` method is used to first normalize all unicode to its maximally compatible and multi code point form.\n2. All slashes are normalized to `/` on Windows systems (on posix systems, ` ` is a valid filename character, and thus left intact).\n3. When a symbolic link is encountered on Windows systems, the entire directory cache is cleared.  Collisions related to use of 8.3 short names to replace directories with other (non symlink) types of entries may make archives fail to extract properly, but will not result in arbitrary file writes.\n\nUpgrade to version 4.4.18 or later\n            ", "related_urls": []}

This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created.\n\nThis logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory, where the symlink and directory names in the archive entry used backslashes as a path separator on posix systems.

If a tar archive contained a directory at `FOO`, followed by a symbolic link named `foo`, then on case insensitive file systems, the creation of the symbolic link would remove the directory from the filesystem, but _not_ from the internal directory cache, as it would not be treated as a cache hit.  A subsequent file entry within the `FOO` directory would then be placed in the target of the symbolic link, thinking that the directory had already been created. \n\nThese issues were addressed in releases 4.4.16, 5.0.8 and 6.1.7.\n\nThe v3 branch of `node tar` has been deprecated and did not receive patches for these issues.

If this is not possible, a workaround is available below.\n\n### Patches\n\n4.4.16 || 5.0.8 || 6.1.7\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUsers may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating a custom filter method which prevents the extraction of symbolic links.\n\n```js\nconst tar = require('tar')\n\ntar.x({\n  file: 'archive.tgz',\n  filter: (file, entry) => {\n    if (entry.type === 'SymbolicLink') {\n      return false\n    } else {\n      return true\n    }\n  }\n})\n```\n\nUsers are encouraged to upgrade to the latest patched versions, rather than attempt to sanitize tar input themselves.\n\n### Fix\n\nThe problem is addressed in the following ways:\n\n1. All paths are normalized to use `/` as a path separator, replacing ` ` with `/` on Windows systems, and leaving ` ` intact in the path on posix systems.  This is performed in depth, at every level of the program where paths are consumed.\n2. Directory cache pruning is performed case insensitively.  This _may_ result in undue cache misses on case sensitive file systems, but the performance impact is negligible.\n\n#### Caveat\n\nNote that this means that the `entry` objects exposed in various parts of tar's API will now always use `/` as a path separator, even on Windows systems.  This is not expected to cause problems, as `/` is a valid path separator on Windows systems, but _may_ result in issues if `entry.path` is compared against a path string coming from some other API such as `fs.realpath()` or `path.resolve()`.\n\nUsers are encouraged to always normalize paths using a well tested method such as `path.resolve()` before comparing paths to one another.\nUpgrade to version 4.4.16 or later\n            ", "related_urls": []}

This is achieved by stripping the absolute path root from any absolute file paths contained in a tar file. For example `/home/user/.bashrc` would turn into `home/user/.bashrc`. \n\nThis logic was insufficient when file paths contained repeated path roots such as `////home/user/.bashrc`. `node tar` would only strip a single path root from such paths.

This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks.

The _Resolution_ section contains details on patched versions.\n\n### Impact\n\nIf `subscriptions: false` is passed to the `ApolloServer` constructor options, there is no impact.  If implementors were not expecting validation rules to be enforced on the WebSocket subscriptions transport **and** are unconcerned about introspection being enabled on the WebSocket subscriptions transport (or were not expecting that), then this advisory is not applicable.  If `introspection: true` is passed to the `ApolloServer` constructor options, the impact is limited to user provided validation rules (i.e., using `validationRules`) since\u00a0there would be no expectation that introspection was disabled.\n\nThe enforcement of user provided validation rules on the HTTP transport is working as intended and is unaffected by this advisory.  Similarly, disabling introspection on the HTTP transport is working as intended and is unaffected by this advisory.\n\n> **Note:** Unless `subscriptions: false` is explicitly passed to the constructor parameters of `new ApolloServer({ ... })`, **subscriptions are enabled by default, whether or not there is a `Subscription` type present in the schema.**  As an alternative to upgrading to a patched version, see the _Workarounds_ section below to disable subscriptions if it is not necessary.\n\nIn cases where `subscriptions: false` is **not** explicitly set, the subscription server **is impacted** since validation rules which are enforced on the main request pipeline within Apollo Server were not being passed to the `SubscriptionServer.create` invocation ([seen here, prior to the patch (https://github.com/apollographql/apollo server/blob/7d6f23443e52a90deb74f152f34bb76eea78ee19/packages/apollo server core/src/ApolloServer.ts#L677 L726)). \n\nThe omitted validation rules for the subscription server include any `validationRules` passed by implementors to the `ApolloServer` constructor which were expected to be enforced on the subscriptions WebSocket endpoint.  **Additionally**, because an internal [`NoIntrospection` (https://github.com/apollographql/apollo server/blob/7d6f23443/packages/apollo server core/src/ApolloServer.ts#L77 L88) validation rule is used to disable introspection, it would have been possible to introspect a server on the WebSocket endpoint that the `SubscriptionServer` creates even though it was not possible on other transports (e.g. HTTP).\n\n**The severity of risk depends on whether sensitive information is being stored in the schema itself.**  The contents of schema descriptions, or secrets which might be revealed by the names of types or field names within those types, will determine the risk to individual implementors.\n\n### Affected packages\n\nThe bug existed in `apollo server core` versions prior to version 2.14.2, however, this means all integration packages (e.g., `apollo server express`, etc.) prior to version 2.14.2 which depend on `apollo server core` for their subscriptions support are affected.  This includes the `apollo server` package that automatically provides an Express server.\n\nTherefore, for officially published Apollo Server packages, the full list of affected packages includes: `apollo server`, `apollo server azure functions`, `apollo server cache memcached`, `apollo server core`, `apollo server cloud functions`, `apollo server cloudflare`, `apollo server express`, `apollo server fastify`, `apollo server hapi`, `apollo server koa`, `apollo server lambda`, and `apollo server micro`.\n\n> Note: The full list included here doesn't fit into the box provided by the GitHub Security Advisories form.\n\n### Resolution\n\nThe problem is resolved in Apollo Server versions 2.14.2 or higher.  If upgrading is not an option, see _Workarounds_ below.  When upgrading, ensure that the affected integration package (e.g., `apollo server express`) **and** the `apollo server core` package are both updated to the patched versions.

{"id": "NPM-1084679", "package": "npm:apollo-server", "purl": "pkg:npm/apollo-server@2.12.0", "package_type": "npm", "package_usage": "N/A", "version": "2.12.0", "fix_version": "2.25.4", "severity": "MEDIUM", "cvss_score": "5.0", "short_description": "# The graphql upload library included in Apollo Server 2 is vulnerable to CSRF mutations\n### Impact\nThe [graphql upload (https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql upload) npm package can execute GraphQL operations contained in `content type: multipart/form data` POST requests. Because they are POST requests, they can contain GraphQL mutations. Because they use `content type: multipart/form data`, they can be \"simple requests\" which are not preflighted by browsers.\n\nIf your GraphQL server uses `graphql upload` and uses `SameSite=None` cookies for authentication, then JS on any origin can cause browsers to send cookie authenticated mutations to your GraphQL server, which will be executed without checking your CORS policy first. (The attack won't be able to see the response to the mutation if your CORS policy is set up properly, but the side effects of the mutation will still happen.)\n\nAdditionally, if your GraphQL server uses `graphql upload` relies on network properties for security (whether by explicitly looking at the client's IP address or by only being available on a private network), then JS on any origin can cause browsers (which may be on a private network or have an allowed IP address) to send mutations to your GraphQL server, which will be executed without checking your CORS policy first. (This attack does not require your server to use cookies. It is in some cases prevented by some browsers such as Chrome.)\n\nApollo Server 2 bundled `graphql upload` and enabled it by default, so by default, Apollo Server 2 servers are vulnerable to these CSRF attacks.  (Apollo Server 1 did not bundle `graphql upload`. Apollo Server 3 no longer bundles `graphql upload`, although AS3's docs do document how to manually integrate with `graphql upload`.) It is enabled even if your server makes no use of the upload functionality.\n\nIf you are running Apollo Server 2 (older than v2.25.4) and do not specify `uploads: false` to `new ApolloServer`, then you are vulnerable to this CSRF mutation attack.\n\nWe recently introduced an opt in CSRF prevention feature in Apollo Server 3.7.  This feature successfully protects against CSRF even if you have manually integrated your AS3.7 server with `graphql upload`. However, this feature is not available for Apollo Server 2.\n\n### Patches\nIf you are using Apollo Server 2 and do *not* actually use uploads in your schema (ie, the `Upload` scalar is not used as the argument to any field or in any input object definition, and you do not specify `uploads` to `new ApolloServer`), then upgrading to Apollo Server 2.25.4 will automatically disable `graphql upload` in your server.  This will fix the CSRF mutation vulnerability.\n\nUpgrading to v2.25.4 does still leave your server vulnerable to non mutation CSRF attacks such as timing attacks against query operations. To protect yourself against these potentially lower impact CSRF attack, we encourage upgrading to Apollo Server v3.7 and enabling CSRF prevention. See [the Apollo Server 3 migration guide (https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo server/migration/) and the [CSRF prevention docs (https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo server/security/cors/#preventing cross site request forgery csrf) for details.\n\nIf you are actively using the uploads feature with Apollo Server 2, then upgrading to v2.25.4 will not disable the feature and you will still be vulnerable. You should instead upgrade to v3.7 and enable the CSRF prevention feature.\n\nIf you are manually integrating the `graphql upload` package with any version of Apollo Server (or any Node GraphQL server) and need to continue using the feature, then you must enable some sort of CSRF prevention feature to fix this vulnerability. We recommend the CSRF prevention feature in Apollo Server 3.7.\n\n### Workarounds\nInstead of upgrading your Apollo Server 2 server, you can specify `uploads: false` to `new ApolloServer` to disable the `graphql upload` integration and protect against CSRF mutations. (Only do this if you do not actually use the uploads feature in your server!) This will still leave your server vulnerable to non mutation CSRF attacks such as timing attacks against query operations; you need to upgrade to v3.7 and enable CSRF prevention to protect against these attacks.\n\n### Related work\n  [PR adding a Security section to the GraphQL multipart request spec (https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql multipart request spec/pull/64)\nUpgrade to version 2.25.4 or later\n            ", "related_urls": []}
