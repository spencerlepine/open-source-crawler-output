            <td># Cross site Scripting Vulnerability in GraphQL Playground (distributed by Apollo Server)<br/>### Impact<br/>In certain configurations, Apollo Server serves the client side web app "GraphQL Playground" from the same web server that executes GraphQL operations. This web app has access to cookies and other credentials associated with the web server's operations. There is a cross site scripting vulnerability in GraphQL Playground that allows for arbitrary JavaScript code execution in your web server's origin. If a user clicks a specially crafted link to your GraphQL Playground page served by Apollo Server, an attacker can steal cookies and other private browser data.<br/><br/>Details of the underlying GraphQL Playground vulnerability are available in [this `graphql playground` advisory (https://github.com/graphql/graphql playground/security/advisories/GHSA 59r9 6jp6 jcm7). (A [similar vulnerability (https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/security/advisories/GHSA x4r7 m2q9 69c8) exists in the related `graphiql` project.) This advisory focuses on identifying whether *Apollo Server* installations are vulnerable and mitigating the vulnerability in Apollo Server; see the other advisories for details on the XSS vulnerability itself.<br/><br/>The impact of this vulnerability is more severe if (as is common) your GraphQL server's origin URL is an origin that is used to store sensitive data such as cookies.<br/><br/>In order for this vulnerability to affect your Apollo Server installation, it must actually serve GraphQL Playground. The integration between Apollo Server and GraphQL Playground is different in Apollo Server 2 and Apollo Server 3. You can tell which version of Apollo Server you are running by looking at the version of the [package from which you import the `ApolloServer` class (https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo server/integrations/middleware/): this may be `apollo server`, `apollo server express`, `apollo server lambda`, etc.<br/><br/>#### Apollo Server 3<br/><br/>Apollo Server 3 does not serve GraphQL Playground by default. It has a [landing page plugin system (https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo server/api/plugin/landing pages/) and the default plugin is a simple splash page that is not vulnerable to this exploit, linking to Apollo Sandbox Explorer. (We chose to change the default because GraphQL Playground is not actively maintained.)<br/><br/>If you are running Apollo Server 3, then you are *only* vulnerable if you *explicitly* import the [`ApolloServerPluginLandingPageGraphQLPlayground` (https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo server/api/plugin/landing pages/#graphql playground landing page) plugin and pass it to your `ApolloServer`'s constructor in the `plugins` array. Otherwise, this advisory does not apply to your server.<br/><br/>#### Apollo Server 2<br/><br/>Apollo Server 2 serves GraphQL Playground by default, unless the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is set to `production`, or if you explicitly configure it via the `playground` option to the `ApolloServer` constructor.<br/><br/>Your Apollo Server 2 installation is vulnerable if *any* of the following is true:<br/>  You pass `playground: true` to the `ApolloServer` constructor<br/>  You pass some other object like `playground: {title: "Title"}` to the `ApolloServer` constructor<br/>  You do *not* pass any `playground` option to the `ApolloServer` constructor, *and* the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is *not* set to `production`<br/><br/>#### Apollo Server 1<br/><br/>Apollo Server 1 included `graphiql` instead of `graphql playground`. `graphiql` isn't automatically enabled in Apollo Server 1: you have to explicitly call a function such as `graphiqlExpress` to enable it. Because Apollo Server 1 is not commonly used, we have not done a detailed examination of whether the integration between Apollo Server 1 and `graphiql` is vulnerable to a similar exploit. If you are still using Apollo Server 1, we recommend you disable `graphiql` by removing the `graphiqlExpress` call, and then <b>upgrade</b> to a newer version of Apollo Server.<br/><br/>### Patches and workarounds<br/><br/>There are several approaches you can take to ensure that your server is not vulnerable to this issue.<br/><br/>#### Upgrade Apollo Server<br/><br/>The vulnerability has been patched in Apollo Server 2.25.3 and Apollo Server 3.4.1. To get the patch, <b>upgrade</b> your [Apollo Server entry point package (https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo server/integrations/middleware/) to one of the fixed versions; this package may be `apollo server`, `apollo server express`, `apollo server lambda`, etc. Additionally, if you depend directly on `apollo server core` in your `package.json`, make sure that you <b>upgrade</b> it to the same version.<br/><br/>#### Upgrade Playground version only<br/><br/>If upgrading to the latest version of Apollo Server 2 or 3 quickly will be challenging, you can configure your current version of Apollo Server to serve the latest version of the GraphQL Playground app. This will pin your app to serve a specific version of GraphQL Playground and you will not receive updates to it when you <b>upgrade</b> Apollo Server later, but this may be acceptable because GraphQL Playground is not actively maintained.<br/><br/>The way to do this depends on what version of Apollo Server you're using and if you're already configuring GraphQL Playground.<br/><br/>  **Apollo Server 3**: If you are using Apollo Server 3, then you are only vulnerable if your serve explicitly calls [`ApolloServerPluginLandingPageGraphQLPlayground` (https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo server/api/plugin/landing pages/#graphql playground landing page) and passes it to the Apollo Server constructor in the `plugins` array. Add the option `version: '1.7.42'` to this call, so it looks like:<br/>```<br/>plugins: [ApolloServerPluginLandingPageGraphQLPlayground({version: '1.7.42'}) <br/>```<br/>  **Apollo Server 2 with no explicit `playground` option**: If you are using Apollo Server 2 and do not currently pass the `playground` option to `new ApolloServer`, add a `playground` option like so: <br/>```<br/>new ApolloServer({ playground: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? false : { version: '1.7.42' } })<br/>```<br/>  **Apollo Server 2 with `playground: true` or `playground: {x, y, z}`**: If you are using Apollo Server 2 and currently pass `true` or an object to `new ApolloServer`, pass the `version` option under the `playground` option like so:<br/>```<br/>new ApolloServer({ playground: { version: '1.7.42', x, y, z } })<br/>```<br/><br/>#### Disable GraphQL Playground<br/><br/>If upgrading Apollo Server or GraphQL Playground is challenging, you can also disable GraphQL Playground.<br/><br/>In Apollo Server 3, remove the call to `ApolloServerPluginLandingPageGraphQLPlayground` from your `ApolloServer` constructor's `plugins` array. This will replace GraphQL Playground with a simple splash page. See [the landing page plugins docs (https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo server/api/plugin/landing pages/) for details.<br/><br/>In Apollo Server 2, add `playground: false` to your `ApolloServer` constructor: `new ApolloServer({ playground: false })`. This will replace GraphQL Playground with an attempt to execute a GraphQL operation, which will likely display an error in the browser.<br/><br/>If you disable GraphQL Playground, any users who rely on it to execute GraphQL operations will need an alternative, such as the [Apollo Studio Explorer's account free Sandbox (https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/explorer/#account free sandbox).<br/><br/>### Credit<br/><br/>This vulnerability was discovered by @Ry0taK. Thank you!<br/><br/>The fix to GraphQL Playground was developed by @acao and @glasser with help from @imolorhe, @divyenduz, and @benjie.<br/><br/><br/>### For more information<br/>If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:<br/>* Read the [`graphql playground` advisory (https://github.com/graphql/graphql playground/security/advisories/GHSA 59r9 6jp6 jcm7)<br/>* Open an issue in [the `apollo server` repo (https://github.com/apollographql/apollo server/)<br/>* If the issue involves confidential information, email us at [security@apollographql.com (mailto:security@apollographql.com)<br/><br/>Upgrade to version 2.25.3 or later<br/>            </td>

If implementors were not expecting validation rules to be enforced on the WebSocket subscriptions transport **and** are unconcerned about introspection being enabled on the WebSocket subscriptions transport (or were not expecting that), then this advisory is not applicable.  If `introspection: true` is passed to the `ApolloServer` constructor options, the impact is limited to user provided validation rules (i.e., using `validationRules`) since there would be no expectation that introspection was disabled.<br/><br/>The enforcement of user provided validation rules on the HTTP transport is working as intended and is un<b>affected</b> by this advisory.  Similarly, disabling introspection on the HTTP transport is working as intended and is un<b>affected</b> by this advisory.<br/><br/>> **Note:** Unless `subscriptions: false` is explicitly passed to the constructor parameters of `new ApolloServer({ ... })`, **subscriptions are enabled by default, whether or not there is a `Subscription` type present in the schema.**  As an alternative to upgrading to a patched version, see the _Workarounds_ section below to disable subscriptions if it is not necessary.<br/><br/>In cases where `subscriptions: false` is **not** explicitly set, the subscription server **is <b>impacted</b>** since validation rules which are enforced on the main request pipe<span class='bg-light chip d-inline-flex mb-1'>line</span>within Apollo Server were not being passed to the `SubscriptionServer.create` invocation ([seen here, prior to the patch (https://github.com/apollographql/apollo server/blob/7d6f23443e52a90deb74f152f34bb76eea78ee19/packages/apollo server core/src/ApolloServer.ts#L677 L726)). <br/><br/>The omitted validation rules for the subscription server include any `validationRules` passed by implementors to the `ApolloServer` constructor which were expected to be enforced on the subscriptions WebSocket endpoint.  **Additionally**, because an internal [`NoIntrospection` (https://github.com/apollographql/apollo server/blob/7d6f23443/packages/apollo server core/src/ApolloServer.ts#L77 L88) validation rule is used to disable introspection, it would have been possible to introspect a server on the WebSocket endpoint that the `SubscriptionServer` creates even though it was not possible on other transports (e.g. HTTP).<br/><br/>**The severity of risk depends on whether sensitive information is being stored in the schema itself.**  The contents of schema descriptions, or secrets which might be revealed by the names of types or field names within those types, will determine the risk to individual implementors.<br/><br/>### Affected packages<br/><br/>The bug existed in `apollo server core` versions prior to version 2.14.2, however, this means all integration packages (e.g., `apollo server express`, etc.) prior to version 2.14.2 which depend on `apollo server core` for their subscriptions support are <b>affected</b>.  This includes the `apollo server` package that automatically provides an Express server.<br/><br/>Therefore, for officially published Apollo Server packages, the full list of <b>affected</b> packages includes: `apollo server`, `apollo server azure functions`, `apollo server cache memcached`, `apollo server core`, `apollo server cloud functions`, `apollo server cloudflare`, `apollo server express`, `apollo server fastify`, `apollo server hapi`, `apollo server koa`, `apollo server lambda`, and `apollo server micro`.<br/><br/>> Note: The full list included here doesn't fit into the box provided by the GitHub Security Advisories form.<br/><br/>### Resolution<br/><br/>The problem is resolved in Apollo Server versions 2.14.2 or higher.  If upgrading is not an option, see _Workarounds_ below.  When upgrading, ensure that the <b>affected</b> integration package (e.g., `apollo server express`) **and** the `apollo server core` package are both updated to the patched versions.  (The version numbers should both be  2.14.2.)<br/><br/>### Workarounds<br/><br/>Upgrading to a patched version is the recommended solution.  If upgrading is not an option, subscriptions can be disabled with `subscriptions: false` to resolve the impact.  **Disabling subscriptions in this way will disable _all_ subscriptions support and the WebSocket transport**:<br/><br/>```js<br/>const server = new ApolloServer({<br/>  subscriptions: false,<br/>  /* Other options, such as typeDefs, resolvers, schema, etc. */<br/>});<br/>```<br/><br/>### For more information<br/>If you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please [open an issue (https://github.com/apollographql/apollo server/issues/new) and the maintainers will try to assist.<br/><br/>### Credit and appreciation<br/><br/>Apollo fully believes in ethical disclosure of vulnerabilities by security researchers who notify us with details and provide us time to address and fix the issues before publicly disclosing.<br/><br/>Credit for this discovery goes to the team at [Bitwala (https://www.bitwala.com/), who reported the concern to us responsibly after discovering it during their own auditing.<br/>Upgrade to version 2.14.2 or later<br/>            </td>

Because they are POST requests, they can contain GraphQL mutations. Because they use `content type: multipart/form data`, they can be "simple requests" which are not preflighted by browsers.<br/><br/>If your GraphQL server uses `graphql upload` and uses `SameSite=None` cookies for authentication, then JS on any origin can cause browsers to send cookie authenticated mutations to your GraphQL server, which will be executed without checking your CORS policy first. (The attack won't be able to see the response to the mutation if your CORS policy is set up properly, but the side effects of the mutation will still happen.)<br/><br/>Additionally, if your GraphQL server uses `graphql upload` relies on network properties for security (whether by explicitly looking at the client's IP address or by only being available on a private network), then JS on any origin can cause browsers (which may be on a private network or have an allowed IP address) to send mutations to your GraphQL server, which will be executed without checking your CORS policy first. (This attack does not require your server to use cookies. It is in some cases prevented by some browsers such as Chrome.)<br/><br/>Apollo Server 2 bundled `graphql upload` and enabled it by default, so by default, Apollo Server 2 servers are vulnerable to these CSRF attacks.  (Apollo Server 1 did not bundle `graphql upload`. Apollo Server 3 no longer bundles `graphql upload`, although AS3's docs do document how to manually integrate with `graphql upload`.) It is enabled even if your server makes no use of the upload functionality.<br/><br/>If you are running Apollo Server 2 (older than v2.25.4) and do not specify `uploads: false` to `new ApolloServer`, then you are vulnerable to this CSRF mutation attack.<br/><br/>We recently introduced an opt in CSRF prevention feature in Apollo Server 3.7.  This feature successfully protects against CSRF even if you have manually integrated your AS3.7 server with `graphql upload`. However, this feature is not available for Apollo Server 2.<br/><br/>### Patches<br/>If you are using Apollo Server 2 and do *not* actually use uploads in your schema (ie, the `Upload` scalar is not used as the argument to any field or in any input object definition, and you do not specify `uploads` to `new ApolloServer`), then upgrading to Apollo Server 2.25.4 will automatically disable `graphql upload` in your server.  This will fix the CSRF mutation vulnerability.<br/><br/>Upgrading to v2.25.4 does still leave your server vulnerable to non mutation CSRF attacks such as timing attacks against query operations. To protect yourself against these potentially lower impact CSRF attack, we encourage upgrading to Apollo Server v3.7 and enabling CSRF prevention. See [the Apollo Server 3 migration guide (https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo server/migration/) and the [CSRF prevention docs (https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo server/security/cors/#preventing cross site request forgery csrf) for details.<br/><br/>If you are actively using the uploads feature with Apollo Server 2, then upgrading to v2.25.4 will not disable the feature and you will still be vulnerable. You should instead <b>upgrade</b> to v3.7 and enable the CSRF prevention feature.<br/><br/>If you are manually integrating the `graphql upload` package with any version of Apollo Server (or any Node GraphQL server) and need to continue using the feature, then you must enable some sort of CSRF prevention feature to fix this vulnerability. We recommend the CSRF prevention feature in Apollo Server 3.7.<br/><br/>### Workarounds<br/>Instead of upgrading your Apollo Server 2 server, you can specify `uploads: false` to `new ApolloServer` to disable the `graphql upload` integration and protect against CSRF mutations. (Only do this if you do not actually use the uploads feature in your server!) This will still leave your server vulnerable to non mutation CSRF attacks such as timing attacks against query operations; you need to <b>upgrade</b> to v3.7 and enable CSRF prevention to protect against these attacks.<br/><br/>### Related work<br/>  [PR adding a Security section to the GraphQL multipart request spec (https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql multipart request spec/pull/64)<br/>Upgrade to version 2.25.4 or later<br/>            </td>

            <td># yargs parser Vulnerable to Prototype Pollution<br/>Affected versions of `yargs parser` are vulnerable to prototype pollution. Arguments are not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to modify the prototype of `Object`, causing the addition or modification of an existing property that will exist on all objects.  <br/>Parsing the argument `  foo.__proto__.bar baz'` adds a `bar` property with value `baz` to all objects. This is only exploitable if attackers have control over the arguments being passed to `yargs parser`.<br/><br/><br/><br/>## Recommendation<br/><br/>Upgrade to versions 13.1.2, 15.0.1, 18.1.1 or later.<br/>Upgrade to version 5.0.1 or later<br/>            </td>
