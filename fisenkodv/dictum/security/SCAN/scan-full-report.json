The second receives this sensitive information from the request body of a POST request.\\n\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst express = require('express');\\nconst app = express();\\napp.use(require('body-parser').urlencoded({ extended: false }))\\n\\n// bad: sensitive information is read from query parameters\\napp.get('/login1', (req, res) => {\\n    const user = req.query.user;\\n    const password = req.query.password;\\n    if (checkUser(user, password)) {\\n        res.send('Welcome');\\n    } else {\\n        res.send('Access denied');\\n    }\\n});\\n\\n// good: sensitive information is read from post body\\napp.post('/login2', (req, res) => {\\n    const user = req.body.user;\\n    const password = req.body.password;\\n    if (checkUser(user, password)) {\\n        res.send('Welcome');\\n    } else {\\n        res.send('Access denied');\\n    }\\n});\\n\\n```\\n\\n## References\\n* CWE: [CWE-598: Use of GET Request Method with Sensitive Query Strings](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/598.html)\\n* PortSwigger (Burp): [Password Submitted using GET Method](https://portswigger.net/kb/issues/00400300_password-submitted-using-get-method)\\n* OWASP: [Information Exposure through Query Strings in URL](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Information_exposure_through_query_strings_in_url)\\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-598](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/598.html).\\n\""}, "endLine": 1942, "startLine": 1942}}}], "properties": {"issue_confidence": "MEDIUM", "issue_severity": "HIGH", "issue_tags": {}}, "baselineState": "new", "partialFingerprints": {"scanPrimaryLocationHash": "1d1c2da8d5dd1d46", "scanFileHash": "5123ab794e2e8e10"}, "ruleId": "CWE-312", "ruleIndex": 0}, {"message": {"markdown": "", "text": "Credential in plaintext?\n\nRule: Env Var\nLine:             \"text\" : \"# Host header poisoning in email generation\\nUsing the HTTP Host header to construct a link in an email can facilitate phishing attacks and leak password reset tokens.
