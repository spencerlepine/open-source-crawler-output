In many typical Express use cases, an unauthenticated remote attacker can place the attack payload in the query string of the URL that is used to visit the application, such as a[__proto__]=b&a[__proto__]&a[length]=100000000. The fix was backported to qs 6.9.7, 6.8.3, 6.7.3, 6.6.1, 6.5.3, 6.4.1, 6.3.3, and 6.2.4 (and therefore Express 4.17.3, which has \"deps: qs@6.9.7\" in its release description, is not vulnerable).", "related_urls": ["https://github.com/n8tz/CVE-2022-24999", "https://github.com/expressjs/express/releases/tag/4.17.3", "https://github.com/ljharb/qs/pull/428", "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/01/msg00039.html"]}
