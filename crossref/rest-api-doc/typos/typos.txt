error: `metdata` should be `metadata`
  --> ./api_tips.md:26:165
   |
26 | What? No, seriously- Crossref periodically releases [public data file](https://www.crossref.org/blog/new-public-data-file-120-million-metadata-records/) of all the metdata that is available via our public API. You can download this file from [Academic Torrents](https://academictorrents.com/) with your favorite torrent client and do a lot of work locally if you want to. At the very least, having the local file will allow you to focus on using the API only for metadata records that have been updated since the last public data file was released.

DOI prefixes merely serve as a namespace form which a member can create new DOIs without worrying about collisions. But, once created, Crossref DOIs are often transfered between publishers and so a Crossref member will often be responsible for DOIs with a variety of prefixes.
