I would sooner my men die fighting for the Ned's little girl than alone and hungry in the snow, weeping tears that freeze upon their cheeks.  No one sings songs of men who die like that.  As for me, I am old.  This will be my last winter.  Let me bathe in Bolton blood before I die.  I want to feel it splatter across my face when my axe bites deep into a Bolton skull.  I want to lick it off my lips and die with the taste of it on my tongue. ",

The Freys might not care, but the northmen... they fear the Dreadfort, but they love the Starks.  Not me, but the rest, yes.  Old Whoresbane is only here because the Freys hold the Greatjon captive.  And do you imagine the Hornwood men have forgotten the Bastard's last marriage, and how his lady wife was left to starve, chewing her own fingers?  What do you think passes through their heads when they hear the new bride weeping?  Valiant Ned's precious little girl.  Lady Arya's sobs do us more harm than all of Lord Stannis's swords and spears.
