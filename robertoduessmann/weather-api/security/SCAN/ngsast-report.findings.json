This means the emails will be sent out to potential victims, originating from a server they trust, but with links leading to a malicious web site.\\n\\nIf the email contains a password reset link, and should the victim click the link, the secret reset token will be leaked to the attacker. Using the leaked token, the attacker can then construct the real reset link and use it to change the victim's password.\\n\\n\\n## Recommendation\\nObtain the server's host name from a configuration file and avoid relying on the Host header.\\n\\n\\n## Example\\nThe following example uses the `req.host` to generate a password reset link. This value is derived from the Host header, and can thus be set to anything by an attacker:\\n\\n\\n```javascript\\nlet nodemailer = require('nodemailer');\\nlet express = require('express');\\nlet backend = require('./backend');\\n\\nlet app = express();\\n\\nlet config = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('config.json', 'utf8'));\\n\\napp.post('/resetpass', (req, res) => {\\n  let email = req.query.email;\\n  let transport = nodemailer.createTransport(config.smtp);\\n  let token = backend.getUserSecretResetToken(email);\\n  transport.sendMail({\\n    from: 'webmaster@example.com',\\n    to: email,\\n    subject: 'Forgot password',\\n    text: `Click to reset password: https://${req.host}/resettoken/${token}`,\\n  });\\n});\\n\\n```\\nTo ensure the link refers to the correct web site, get the host name from a configuration file:\\n\\n\\n```javascript\\nlet nodemailer = require('nodemailer');\\nlet express = require('express');\\nlet backend = require('./backend');\\n\\nlet app = express();\\n\\nlet config = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync('config.json', 'utf8'));\\n\\napp.post('/resetpass', (req, res) => {\\n  let email = req.query.email;\\n  let transport = nodemailer.createTransport(config.smtp);\\n  let token = backend.getUserSecretResetToken(email);\\n  transport.sendMail({\\n    from: 'webmaster@example.com',\\n    to: email,\\n    subject: 'Forgot password',\\n    text: `Click to reset password: https://${config.hostname}/resettoken/${token}`,\\n  });\\n});\\n\\n```\\n\\n## References\\n* Mitre: [CWE-640: Weak Password Recovery Mechanism for Forgotten Password](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/640.html).\\n* Ian Muscat: [What is a Host Header Attack?](https://www.acunetix.com/blog/articles/automated-detection-of-host-header-attacks/).\\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-640](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/640.html).\\n\""}, "tags": [{"key": "cwe_category", "value": "312", "shiftleft_managed": true}]}, {"app": "open-source-crawler", "type": "extscan", "title": "Use of net/http serve function that has no support for setting timeouts.", "description": "The program invokes a potentially dangerous function that could introduce a vulnerability if it is used incorrectly, but the function can also be used safely.\n\n## Additional information\n\n**[CWE-676](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/676.html)**", "internal_id": "CWE-676/0f0a8d559e08bdfe89668603f30746a2", "severity": "moderate", "owasp_category": "", "category": "CWE-676", "details": {"repoContext": {"gitProvider": "github", "ciProvider": "github", "repositoryName": "open-source-crawler", "repositoryUri": "https://github.com/spencerlepine/open-source-crawler", "revisionId": "735748ce709a4271f6944b183a2c0a8c2573b40f", "branch": "main", "invokedBy": "Roberto Duessmann <roberto.duessmann@gmail.com>", "pullRequest": false, "botUser": false}, "name": "Use of net/http serve function that has no support for setting timeouts.", "tags": "Scan", "fileName": "https://github.com/robertoduessmann/weather-api/main.go", "DATA_TYPE": "OSS_SCAN", "lineNumber": 30, "ruleId": "CWE-676", "ruleName": "", "contextText": "\tif err := http.ListenAndServe(\":\"+config.Get().Port, handlers.CORS()(weather)); err != nil {\n", "snippetText": "\n\tif err := http.ListenAndServe(\":\"+config.Get().Port, handlers.CORS()(weather)); err != nil {\n"}, "tags": [{"key": "cwe_category", "value": "676", "shiftleft_managed": true}]}, {"app": "open-source-crawler", "type": "extscan", "title": "Potential HTTP request made with variable url.", "description": "The software constructs a string for a command to executed by a separate component in another control sphere, but it does not properly delimit the intended arguments, options, or switches within that command string.\n\n## Additional information\n\n**[CWE-88](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/88.html)**", "internal_id": "CWE-88/813500de3cae78f44766342b6922aa08", "severity": "moderate", "owasp_category": "", "category": "CWE-88", "details": {"repoContext": {"gitProvider": "github", "ciProvider": "github", "repositoryName": "open-source-crawler", "repositoryUri": "https://github.com/spencerlepine/open-source-crawler", "revisionId": "735748ce709a4271f6944b183a2c0a8c2573b40f", "branch": "main", "invokedBy": "Roberto Duessmann <roberto.duessmann@gmail.com>", "pullRequest": false, "botUser": false}, "name": "Potential HTTP request made with variable url.", "tags": "Scan", "fileName": "https://github.com/robertoduessmann/weather-api/controller/v2/weather.go", "DATA_TYPE": "OSS_SCAN", "lineNumber": 156, "ruleId": "CWE-88", "ruleName": "", "contextText": "\tres, err := http.Get(uri)\n", "snippetText": "\turi := fmt.Sprintf(\"%s/%s?format=j1\", wttrURL, city)\n\tres, err := http.Get(uri)\n"}, "tags": [{"key": "cwe_category", "value": "88", "shiftleft_managed": true}]}]}
