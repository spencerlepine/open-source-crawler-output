Sensitive information within URLs may be logged in various locations, including the user's browser, the web server, and any forward or reverse proxy servers between the two endpoints. URLs may also be displayed on-screen, bookmarked or emailed around by users. They may be disclosed to third parties via the Referer header when any off-site links are followed. Placing sensitive information into the URL therefore increases the risk that it will be captured by an attacker.\\n\\n\\n## Recommendation\\nUse HTTP POST to send sensitive information as part of the request body; for example, as form data.\\n\\n\\n## Example\\nThe following example shows two route handlers that both receive a username and a password. The first receives this sensitive information from the query parameters of a GET request, which is transmitted in the URL. The second receives this sensitive information from the request body of a POST request.\\n\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst express = require('express');\\nconst app = express();\\napp.use(require('body-parser').urlencoded({ extended: false }))\\n\\n// bad: sensitive information is read from query parameters\\napp.get('/login1', (req, res) => {\\n    const user = req.query.user;\\n    const password = req.query.password;\\n    if (checkUser(user, password)) {\\n        res.send('Welcome');\\n    } else {\\n        res.send('Access denied');\\n    }\\n});\\n\\n// good: sensitive information is read from post body\\napp.post('/login2', (req, res) => {\\n    const user = req.body.user;\\n    const password = req.body.password;\\n    if (checkUser(user, password)) {\\n        res.send('Welcome');\\n    } else {\\n        res.send('Access denied');\\n    }\\n});\\n\\n```\\n\\n## References\\n* CWE: [CWE-598: Use of GET Request Method with Sensitive Query Strings](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/598.html)\\n* PortSwigger (Burp): [Password Submitted using GET Method](https://portswigger.net/kb/issues/00400300_password-submitted-using-get-method)\\n* OWASP: [Information Exposure through Query Strings in URL](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Information_exposure_through_query_strings_in_url)\\n* Common Weakness Enumeration: [CWE-598](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/598.html).\\n\""}, "endLine": 1801, "startLine": 1801}}}], "properties": {"issue_confidence": "MEDIUM", "issue_severity": "HIGH", "issue_tags": {}}, "baselineState": "new", "partialFingerprints": {"scanPrimaryLocationHash": "1d1c2da8d5dd1d46", "scanFileHash": "9ccb5a444d994747"}, "ruleId": "CWE-312", "ruleIndex": 0}, {"message": {"markdown": "", "text": "Credential in plaintext?\n\nRule: Env Var\nLine:             \"text\" : \"# Host header poisoning in email generation\\nUsing the HTTP Host header to construct a link in an email can facilitate phishing attacks and leak password reset tokens.
